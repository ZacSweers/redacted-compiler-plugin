Changelog
=========

1.4.0
-----

_2023-04-03_

1.3.1
-----

_2023-03-16_

1.3.0
-----

_2022-12-28_

- Update to Kotlin `1.8.0`. This release is only compatible with Kotlin 1.8 or later.
- Update JVM target to `11`.
- Kotlin JS artifact now only supports IR.
- Migrate the IR and FIR plugins to new `CompilerPluginRegistrar` entrypoint API.

1.2.1
-----

_2022-12-03_

This release is primarily under-the-hood changes + extra compile-time checks.

- [IR] Fail compilation if both class and any number of properties are annotated with `@Redacted`.
- [IR] Fail compilation if `@Redacted` is used in a non-class context.
  - Before it would only check if the class is non-data, but with Kotlin 1.8 introducing `data object` classes we need to also check that the target type is itself a class.
- [IR] Fail compilation if a custom `toString()` function is implemented in a data class using `@Redacted`.
- [IR] Harden `toString()` function declaration matching.
- [FIR] Promote `REDACTED_ON_CLASS_AND_PROPERTY_WARNING` to error.
- Update to Kotlin 1.7.22.

1.2.0
-----

_2022-10-03_

Experimental support for the new K2 compiler + FIR plugin.

Note this comes with several caveats:
- No IDE support yet
- Errors and warnings can't have custom messages yet: [KT-53510](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-53510).
- Multiple errors and warnings result in only a single error being emitted: [KT-54287](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-54287).
- K2 compiler itself is extremely experimental.

In short, this is only really to unblock anyone doing their own testing of K2 and don't want this
plugin to disable it. If you see any issues, please file a bug here and disable K2 in your project
in the meantime.

Details on K2 and instructions for enabling it can be found here: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew17.html#new-kotlin-k2-compiler-for-the-jvm-in-alpha

Also: update to Kotlin 1.7.20.

1.1.0
-----

_2022-06-09_

Update to Kotlin 1.7.0.

Note that Kotlin 1.7.0 is now the _minimum_ for this version due to breaking API changes in Kotlin IR APIs.

1.0.1
-----

_2022-01-13_

* Use `implementation` instead of `api` adding the `redacted-compiler-plugin-annotations` dependency. [#76](https://github.com/ZacSweers/redacted-compiler-plugin/issues/76)

Thanks to [@gpeal](https://github.com/gpeal) for contributing to this release!

1.0.0
-----

_2021-12-24_

Stable release!

While Kotlin IR is not a stable API, the public API of redacted-compiler-plugin is. This project will use semver only
for its own API but intermediate versions may only work with specific versions of Kotlin (documented in the changelog).

**Changes since 0.10.0**
- Remove remaining obsolete descriptor API usages.
- Update to Kotlin `1.6.10`.

0.10.0
------

_2021-12-20_

This release introduces formal support for Kotlin multiplatform!

There are two parts to this:
- The compiler plugin itself supports all compilation types, not just JVM and Android.
- The first-party annotations artifact is now multiplatform.

The legacy backend support is now removed, IR is required going forward.

0.10.0-RC1
----------

_2021-11-21_

This is a release candidate with support for Kotlin multiplatform. Please test this out and report any issues.

There are two parts to this:
- The compiler plugin itself supports all compilation types, not just JVM and Android.
- The first-party annotations artifact is now multiplatform.

The legacy backend support is now removed, IR is required going forward.

0.8.3
------------

0.8.2
------------

_2021-10-12_

This release was accidentally broken and should not be used! Specifically, the gradle plugin accidentally targeted Java 17.

0.8.1
------------

This release was accidentally broken and should not be used! Specifically, the compiler plugin itself was missing a service file and would not run.

0.8.0
------------

_2021-02-05_

* **Change:** The gradle plugin id is now `dev.zacsweers.redacted`.

* Small IR fixes courtesy of [@DrewHamilton](https://github.com/DrewHamilton)

0.6.0
------------

_2021-01-09_

* Gradle plugin extension now uses modern Gradle `Property` APIs. Minimum Gradle version is now 5.1.
* Android-specific APIs (i.e. `variantFilter`) are now removed. If you still want this, consider
configuring this manually in your own build however you see fit in tandem with the `enabled` property.
* **Fix:** IR supports redacted classes now too.

0.5.0
------------

_2021-01-08_

* **New!** Experimental support for Kotlin IR. Note that IR is still incubating and subject to change.
* Update Kotlin to `1.4.21`.
* Tested up to JDK 15.

0.4.0
------------

_2020-11-27_

**This version requires Kotlin 1.4.20 or higher!**

* Compatible with Kotlin 1.4.20
* Supports Kotlin's new `StringConcatFactory` automatically when `-Xstring-concat` is enabled.
  * See the [Kotlin 1.4.20 announcement post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/11/kotlin-1-4-20-released/) for details on `-Xstring-concat`.

0.3.0
------------

_2020-08-15_

This is identical in functionality to 0.2.0 but built against Kotlin 1.4.

0.2.0-1.4
------------

_2020-07-16_

This is identical in functionality to 0.2.0 but built against Kotlin 1.4. This version is not considered
stable and should only be used for testing compatibility with Kotlin 1.4 pre-releases.

0.2.0
-----

_2020-01-25_

**New:** There's now a batteries-included `redacted-compiler-plugin-annotations` artifact with a `@Redacted`
annotation you can use if you don't want to manage your own. The `redacted` Gradle extension now defaults
to this and will automatically add this annotations artifact to your project dependencies if a custom
one isn't set. This means that, if you use the default, then all you need to do to use this plugin
is simply apply the gradle plugin ðŸŽ‰.

0.1.0
-----

_2020-01-24_

Initial release!
