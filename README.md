redacted-compiler-plugin
========================

A Kotlin compiler plugin that generates redacted `toString()` implementations.

Inspired by the [`auto-value-redacted`](https://github.com/square/auto-value-redacted) extension for AutoValue.

## Usage

Include the gradle plugin in your project, define a `@Redacted` annotation, and apply it to any 
properties that you wish to redact.

```kotlin
@Retention(SOURCE)
@Target(PROPERTY)
annotation class Redacted

data class User(val name: String, @Redacted val phoneNumber: String)
```

When you call `toString()` any `@Redacted` properties are hidden:

```
User(name=Bob, phoneNumber=██)
```

If your annotation is applied to the class, then `toString()` will emit a single replacement string:

```kotlin
@Retention(SOURCE)
@Target(CLASS)
annotation class Redacted

@Redacted
data class SensitiveData(val ssn: String, val birthday: String)
```

```
SensitiveData(██)
```

## Installation

Apply the gradle plugin.

```gradle
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    classpath "dev.zacsweers.redacted:redacted-compiler-plugin-gradle:x.y.z"
  }  
}

apply plugin: 'dev.zacsweers.redacted.redacted-gradle-plugin'
```

And that's it! The default configuration will add the `-annotations` artifact (which has a
`@Redacted` annotation you can use) and wire it all automatically. Just annotate what you want to
redact.

You can configure custom behavior with properties on the `redacted` extension.

```
redacted {
  // Define a custom annotation. The -annotations artifact won't be automatically added to
  // dependencies if you define your own!
  redactedAnnotation = "dev.zacsweers.redacted.annotations.Redacted" // Default

  // Define whether or not this is enabled. Useful if you want to gate this behind a dynamic
  // build configuration.
  enabled = true // Default

  // Define a custom replacement string for redactions.
  replacementString = "██" // Default
}
```

### Android Per-Variant Configuration

If using Android, you can optionally configure the plugin to be applied on a per-variant basis via
`androidVariantFilter`. This is similar to the Android Gradle Plugin's native `variantFilter` API,
except with an `overrideEnabled` function to override the enabled status and there is no
`defaultConfig` property. If not overridden, the default is to match the `redacted` extension's value.
Other `VariantFilter` APIs should behave as expected (buildType, flavors, name, etc).

**Note:** Variants with different `enabled` values will have to be compiled separately. This is common
in most multi-variant projects anyway, but something to be aware of.

```groovy
redacted {
  enabled = true // Default
  androidVariantFilter {
    // Don't enable on debug
    if (buildType.name == "debug") {
      overrideEnabled(false)
    }
  }
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snapshots].

## Caveats

- Kotlin compiler plugins are not a stable API! Compiled outputs from this plugin _should_ be stable,
but usage in newer versions of kotlinc are not guaranteed to be stable.
- IDE support is not currently possible. See [#8](https://github.com/ZacSweers/redacted-compiler-plugin/issues/8).
